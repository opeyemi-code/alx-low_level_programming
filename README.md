# ALX Low-Level Programming - C Programming Language Projects

## Introduction

👋 Hi there! Welcome to my ALX Africa repository dedicated to the C programming language. As a student at ALX Africa, I've eagerly awaited the moment when I could write my first "Hello World!" program in C.

Before embarking on this program, I had never written a single line of code in C nor explored its intricacies. However, with every passing day, I'm gaining a deeper understanding of this powerful language.

This repository serves as a compilation of every project I'll be working on during my journey with the C programming language at ALX Africa.

## Introduction to C Programming Language

The C programming language is an explicit programming language that executes a series of instructions in sequential order. Unlike other programming languages, such as JavaScript, C requires explicit instructions on what to do and how it should behave.

It's fascinating to note that many popular programming languages, including JavaScript, C++, Python, and more, were built on top of C. They share similar syntax, making it easier to transition between languages once you grasp C.

In order for our instructions to be understood by the computer, a compiler is needed to translate our code into the computer's language. Since computers understand binary numbers, which are zeros and ones, the compiler bridges the gap between our human-readable code and the machine's binary language.

## Compilation Process

The compilation process in C consists of four stages:

1. 🧵 **Preprocessor**

   The preprocessor is the first stage of the compilation process. It handles tasks such as removing comments from the source code, including necessary header files, and replacing macro names with their corresponding code snippets.

2. ⚙️ **Compiler**

   The compiler is the second stage. It takes the preprocessed file and converts the source code into an assembled code. This code is closer to the machine language but still requires further processing.

3. 🛠️ **Assembler**

   The third stage of the compilation process is the assembler. It takes the assembled code generated by the compiler and converts it into object code. Object code is represented by zeros and ones, which the computer can understand and execute.

4. 🔗 **Linker**

   The linker is the final stage of the compilation process. It combines and merges all the object code generated by the assembler into a single executable code. Additionally, the linker also links our code to external libraries, consolidating them into one executable file.

## Projects

To get started with my C programming journey, I will be working on the following projects:

- 📂 [0x00_hello_world](https://github.com/opeyemi-code/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world)
- 📂 [0x01_variables_if_else_while](https://github.com/opeyemi-code/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while)

Each project presents unique challenges and opportunities for me to enhance my understanding of the C programming language.

Stay tuned for more exciting updates as I progress through this learning adventure!

Let's code, and remember, in C, the possibilities are limitless! 💪💻✨
