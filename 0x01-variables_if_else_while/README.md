# ALX Africa - C Programming Project

As a student at ALX Africa, I was given a project to explore various aspects of C programming. The project focuses on variables, conditional statements, and while loops. I have completed the project and now I'm ready to push it to GitHub.

## Variables
In this project, I learned about variables in C programming. I covered concepts such as declaring variables, initializing variables, variable types, standard naming conventions for variables, and reserved keywords that should not be used as variable names.

## Operators
Operators play a crucial role in performing operations on variables or values. I studied four basic types of operators:
- Arithmetic operators
- Relational operators
- Logical operators
- Bitwise operators

## If Statement
The `if` statement is an essential part of programming. It allows the execution of a block of code only when a specific condition is met.

```c
if (condition)
{
    // Code to be executed when the condition is true
}
```

## Else if Statement
The else if statement provides an alternative condition to be checked if the preceding condition is not met. It allows us to handle multiple conditions in our program.

```c
if (condition)
{
    // Code to be executed when the first condition is true
}
else if (condition)
{
    // Code to be executed when the first condition is false and this condition is true
}
```
## Else Statement
The else statement is used when none of the preceding conditions are true. It ensures that a block of code is executed in case all other conditions fail.

```c
if (condition)
{
    // Code to be executed when the condition is true
}
else if (condition)
{
    // Code to be executed when the preceding condition is false and this condition is true
}
else
{
    // Code to be executed when all the preceding conditions are false
}
```
## While Loop
The while loop is an important control structure that allows repeated execution of a block of code as long as a specific condition remains true.

```c
while (condition)
{
    // Code to be executed as long as the condition is true
}
```
By completing this project, I have expanded my knowledge and skills in C programming. I am excited to continue my learning journey at ALX Africa and apply these concepts in future projects.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
