## Variables
Variables serve as containers for storing data. They are like labels or identifiers used to grab data that has been stored in them.

## Data Types and their Sizes
Data types are different types of data that can be stored in a variable. Each data type has its own size, which depends on the user's computer.

## printf()
`printf()` is a function provided by the standard library (`<stdio.h>`) in C. It is used to print data to the standard output (`stdout`).

## puts()
`puts()` is another function provided by the standard library (`<stdio.h>`) in C. It is used to print data to the standard output (`stdout`), followed by a newline character.

## putchar()
`putchar()` is a function from the standard library (`<stdio.h>`) in C. It is used to output a single character to the standard output (`stdout`).

## Compilation Process
The compilation process refers to the steps involved in compiling source code in the C programming language. These steps include the preprocessor, compiler, assembler, and linker.

Feel free to explore the tasks and dive deeper into these fundamental concepts of C programming. Happy coding! 😊
